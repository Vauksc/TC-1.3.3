# TC-1.3.3
The program is the card game War

The program should create the deck of cards, shuffle it and divide it evenly between the players (computer and user).
Then the user should be prompted to make a move (e.g., by pressing the "Enter" key).
The user and computer move by placing face-up cards and the cards are compared, the card of greater rank wins and the winner receives all of the cards in play.
If the face-up cards are the same rank, then both players place a face-down and face-up cards and the face up cards are compared.
If the cards are the same rank again it continues in the same pattern until a comparison chooses a winner, who then gets all the cards in play.
The game is won by collecting all the cards.
